# VR Project Demo - Portfolio  [FR](README.md)

Welcome to my virtual reality sandbox project, implementing interactions such as teleportation, object grabbing, and long-distance grabbing (Half Life Alyx). This README.md will provide you with a general description of the project, as well as a link to a YouTube video showcasing a demonstration of these interactions.
Project Description

My virtual reality project is a proof of concept (PoC) portfolio aiming to demonstrate my skills in development with Unity 3D and the use of XR Interaction Toolkit and OpenXR packages. It is an evolving project that will be gradually enriched with new features and enhancements.

The video will provide you with a visual overview of the features of our project, highlighting teleportation, object grabbing, and long-distance grabbing. I hope this will give you a compelling glimpse of the immersive experience that our project can offer.
Prerequisites

To use our virtual reality project, you will need the following:

    Compatible virtual reality headset (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)
    Compatible virtual reality controllers
    A sufficiently powerful computer to run virtual reality applications

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/Louis27140/VRProjectDemo.git

    or download the source code as a ZIP file.

    Vr Project Demo Release

    Follow the specific instructions for your virtual reality headset to set up your development environment.

    Install the necessary dependencies by following the instructions in the project's README file.

    Build and run the virtual reality application on your headset using the appropriate tools and commands.

Assets Store

This project uses assets purchased from the Unity Asset Store to enhance the visual quality and user experience. Please refer to the links below to access the corresponding assets:

    VR Hand Models Mega Pack (Handy Hands - Left & Right)

360° Environment

To create an immersive environment, I used 360-degree panoramic images. I used the following tools to generate and convert these images:

    Skybox: An online tool for generating 360-degree panoramic images.
    Panorama to Cubemap: An online converter that transforms a 360-degree panoramic image into a usable cube texture in Unity.
